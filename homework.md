# Exercises

## Module 1: Loops

For exercises 1-5, come up with the answer without running the code. Use a piece of paper to diagram the flow of execution, if it helps.

1. What will this code print to console?

		  for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) 
	 	  	console.log(x);
2. What will this code print?

		  for (let x = 3; x < 5; x++) 
	 	  	console.log(x);
3. What will this code print?

		  for (let x = 3; x < 1; x++) 
	 	  	console.log(x);
3. What will this code print?

		  for (let x = 3; x > 1; x--) 
	 	  	console.log(x);
	  
4. What will this code print?
		

    	  for (let x = 0; x < 3; x++) 
    	  	for (let y = x; y < 3; y++) 
    	  		console.log([x, y]);

	- What will change if we replace `y = x` with `y = 0`, on the second line?

5. How many times will the function `g` be called in the following code?

				for (let x = 0; x < 3; x++) 
					for (let y = x; y < 3; y++) 
						g();
				
6. Write code that will print to console all numbers between 10 and 3 in decreasing order.

7. Write code that will print to console every combination of two numbers between 2 and 5 as a two-element array, e.g. `[3, 5]`.
